# leaflet_challenge
Contents
- In this repository you will find the html for displaying the leaflet map and in the folder titled "Static"
there are two folders one with CSS code for the style and a js folder with my code. To run the code
after the repository was cloned run the html file in live server and the map will be displayed.

How this code was created
- My tutor Mohamed helped correct my code for getting the map to display. He also helped fix
my styleInfo function and getColor function as they were not running properly. He helped tweak
my code for the radius to make the size of the radius markers smaller. He helped me generate the code
to create the popups and tweaking my code for the legend, and helped me loop through the depth intervals
to properly generate labels.
